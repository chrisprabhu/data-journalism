    From the data sourced from AmericanFactFinder and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
    we can see there is a definite small correlation between the percentage of people who are below
    the poverty line and the percentage of people who are told they are depressed by a health professional.
    The data here is charted state-by-state.
